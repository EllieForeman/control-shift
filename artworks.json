Watery compositions created from underwater sounds and shaped by tidal data, are integrated into the walk, inviting us to consider the potential future of rising sea levels.

Thus it becomes possible to question the hard-wired power relations embedded within internet infrastructures. Cats shift control by making technical specificities accessible in play and through practicing that there are as many teachers as there are cats (people) in the room. This creates space to understand why the internet can be 'shut down' and to consider alternative infrastructures. MIAU ID is playable by people of any age and accessible towards those with variable mobility, neurodiverse peoples and hearing impaired peoples.
