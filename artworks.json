Arjun and Benjamin are programming a series of performative walks using Power Tools to explore issues around power, presence, access, and inclusion. During limited outdoor time, pairs of walkers are invited to take part in remote discussions on the Social Model of Disability. Through opening up these discussions to wider audiences, Power Tools asks us to consider the importance of Accessibility in people’s lives.",
