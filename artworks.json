This methodology is inspired by Peter Sloterdijk‚Äôs quote ‚Äúmagic is the mother of technology‚Äù which implies that every technological advance was initially conceived as an act of imagination that seemed impossible to achieve.", "We will review examples of dissident technology around the globe and adopt a radical change of world-veiw in our conception of the cybernetic through the incorporation of logics of ancient knowledge and the supernatural. The workshop is open to all audiences, though it will be especially compelling for those who are interested in intersectional approaches to technology."],

We will create prototypes of advanced technology to tackle the most central challenges of our current times.
