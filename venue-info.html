                <p>
                    <em>Control Shift Network</em> is a collective of artists, technologists and producers. In 2019 we produced ‘You Make the Rules’ - a day of workshops followed by an algo-rave performance, which was part of <a href="https://day.processing.org/pcd-ww.html" target="_blank">Processing Community Day</a> (a global celebration of ‘art, code and diversity’ initiated by the Processing Foundation). Control Shift has developed from this event and follows in the same ethos, with a focus on accessibility and diverse engagement. This year we have been able to expand the programme to have a more focused curatorial theme, support more artists, presentations of artworks and invited speakers. Big thank you to our funders and supporters.
                </p>

                    Members include Coral Manton, Claire Morley, Lucas Sweeney, James Wood, Ellie Foreman, Alice Haynes, Pete Bennett, Martha King, Becca Rose, Dave Webb, Steve Battle, Martin O'Leary, and Rod Dickinson.
