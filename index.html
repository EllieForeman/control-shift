                    We live in a world where machines increasingly collect information about us, reducing our bodies and the things around us to streams of data. In turn the digital realm can feel abstract, and out of our control. The stuff of computers and digital infrastructure is often hidden out of sight and huge power imbalances exist around who is making technology and who benefits from it. Yet the impact of our interactions with machines and technologies are very much rooted in the body, materials, and emotions.

                    <em>Control Shift</em> asks how we can reframe and rethink our relationships with technology.
                    How could we conceive of new possibilities beyond neoliberal versions of computing? What might happen if there was more space for poetic or tactile engagements with the digital? Can we reconsider our connections, responsibilities and embodied entanglements with technology?
