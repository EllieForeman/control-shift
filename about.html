                <p>
                    <em>Control Shift Network</em> is a collective of artists, technologists and producers. In 2019 we produced ‘You Make the Rules’ - a day of workshops followed by an algo-rave performance, which was part of <a href="https://day.processing.org/pcd-ww.html" target="_blank">Processing Community Day</a> (a global celebration of ‘art, code and diversity’ initiated by the Processing Foundation). Control Shift has developed from this event and follows in the same ethos, with a focus on accessibility and diverse engagement. This year we have been able to expand the programme to have a more focused curatorial theme, support more artists, presentations of artworks and invited speakers. Big thank you to our funders and supporters.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Members include Coral Manton, Claire Morley, Lucas Sweeney, James Wood, Ellie Foreman, Alice Haynes, Pete Bennett, Martha King, Becca Rose, Dave Webb, Steve Battle, Martin O'Leary, and Rod Dickinson.

                    The Control Shift Network meets regularly and works democratically. We are always looking for more people to be part of the network. Please <a href="contact.html">get in touch</a> if you would like to get involved.
