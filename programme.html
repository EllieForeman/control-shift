            We wanted to publicly thank all those who applied to our open call back in March - to share workshops, artworks or provocations.
        </p>       
        <p class="pb-4">
            We were thrilled by the response, having over 180 applications from all over the world. We wish we could have worked
            with more of you and hope we will be able to grow and do so in the future.
            We have selected an exciting mix of brilliant artists and are still shaping the
            programme and working out an appropriate format. We really hope to make the first
            Control Shift happen later this year, but are closely watching the situation and will
            announce more updates soon.
            In the meantime we are thrilled to announce two commissions that we are supporting
            now during the lockdown and strict social distancing period.
            More information below and if you want to hear more from the artists you can join us
            on June 5 th 1pm for a PMstudios lunchtime talk. Where we will discuss further the
            emerging themes of the programme and hear more about these two commissions:

        <h1 class="text-center py-4">Power Tools by Ben and Arjun:</h1>
        <h2>Who we are</h2>
        <p>We are a London-based artist & designer duo exploring alternative forms of Accessibility in relation to Disability Rights in the UK. Our work is grounded in the Social Model of Disability — the belief that people aren’t disabled, but society is disabling.</p>
        <h2>What we do</h2>
        <p>We make physical and digital tools that respond to various communication and access needs. Our work combines and subverts existing communications technologies, video-calling formats and wearable accessories. </p>
        <h2>This current project</h2>
        <p>We will programme a series of 3 paired walks. Each pairing will use our ‘Power tools’ to have remote discussions around the Social Model of Disability, exploring issues around: power & presence, access & inclusion.</p>
        <p>The walk and accompanying conversations will take place during the outdoor activity currently allowed, as part of lockdown measures — although still inaccessible to many. We are interested to explore what impact the current global health crisis may be having on peoples understanding of and empathy with the idea that ‘people aren’t disabled, but society is disabling’.</p> 
        <p class="pb-4">Opening up these discussions as a resource for wider audiences, we hope to encourage others to consider the importance of accessibility in their lives and what they can do to engage with the systems and structures that help and hinder them.</p>

        <h1 class="text-center py-4">Knitwitter by Wisterlitz:</h1>
        <h2>Who we are</h2>
        <p>Wisterlitz is the joint enterprise of Liz Lister and Rebecca (Becky) Hurwitz. We make playful, whimsical, interactive work that aims to engage people in the relationships between science/tech and society. Our work often reflects on the position of women in relation to these areas.</p>
        <h2>What we do</h2>
        <p>Our creative endeavours revolve around the process of making – defined as an iterative process of tinkering and problem solving – done in collaboration. Together, we learn how materials respond as we use them and what tools can do as we try to work with them.</p>
        <h2>This current project</h2>
        <p>Women have used knitting to send secret messages since WW1. Seen a woman helpfully knitting socks for the troops? Maybe she’s a spy encoding secret messages into her knitting, hiding in plain sight. Nowadays, we all send encoded messages all the time. Our instant, digital, text-based, communications are ultimately made up of millions of hidden away zeros and ones that we entrust our phones to interpret for us and keep secret from others. What if we could send our secret messages not as text on a screen, but as an everyday item, something innocuous, hiding in plain sight? </p>
        <h2>Participate</h2>
        <p>You can do just this by using the online Knitwitter binary encoding tools and your knitting skills to hide a message in a piece of knitting, then send your knitting to us. Wisterlitz will then collect, curate and display all the knitted messages we receive. 
            Knitwitter will be a collaborative artwork that creates tactile engagement with digital data. It draws on our intimate yet intangible relationship with the data we generate through personal communications in the digital world, and anyone with knitting needles and yarn can contribute
        </p>
        <p><i>Wisterlitz gratefully acknowledges all contributions, but we won’t be decoding your messages. That data will stay hidden in the knitting.</i></p>
